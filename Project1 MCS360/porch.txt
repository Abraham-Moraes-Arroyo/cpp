there were three little dogs sitting by the porch.
The porch was made of wood, and the sun shinned upon
the porch. In winter, the snow will pile up on the 
porch, and in fall, the porch will be covered in 
yellow and red leaves. The three little dogs 
enjoy spending their mornings in the porch, for
the sun shines upon them and the porch.
