-iostream, namespace, libraries(string, fstream)
- variables and their declarations 
- functions (call by value and call by reference(constant reference))
- for and while loop
- conditional (if, else, switches/ cases)
- arrays
- pointers

Files
- functions operating on files 

Strings

Object Oriented Program (OOP)
- classes 
    -private; public
        - class variables√ü
        - class member functions 
        - friend functions
    - scope resolution
    - Operation overloading
    - inheritence 

There will be dereferncing and and referncing, how to pass an array to a function.
this will test if you know a pointer and if you know how to iterate to an address, and so.
